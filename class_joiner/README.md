### Automatic class opener
Copy your meet link from browser search bar and add it in place of "fill_link_here" like this => "https://meet.google.com/*********"
<br>
{8, 55, 1, "fill_link_here", "Differential_Equations"} ,Here 8 denotes hour,55 denotes minute, 1 denotes day(eg-1 for monday,2 for tuesday,...).This 8 corresponds to Differential Equation class starts at 9 o'clock.<br>
If you have classes at different time change it accordingly. And change the name of the class according to your course(note:Name of the class should not have space,use underscore instead)

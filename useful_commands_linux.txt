1)To convert pptx to pdf in command line 
        $ libreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf *.pptx
	
	"--headless"
	Starts in "headless mode", which allows using the application without a 		user interface.
	This special mode can be used when the application is controlled by 		external clients via the API...
	It implies --invisible and strictly ignores any GUI environment.
	
	--invisible
	Starts in invisible mode.
	Neither the start-up logo nor the initial program window will be visible. 	LO can be controlled and documents and dialogs can be opened via the API.
	When started with this parameter, it can only be quit using the taskmanager 		(Windows) or the kill command (UNIX based systems). 
	
2)To convert multiple pdf to single pdf
	$ sudo apt install poppler-utils
	$ pdfunite file1.pdf file2.pdf merged-output.pdf

	$ pdf2ps

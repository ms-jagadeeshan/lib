1)To convert pptx to pdf in command line 
        $ libreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf *.pptx
	
	"--headless"
	Starts in "headless mode", which allows using the application without a 		user interface.
	This special mode can be used when the application is controlled by 		external clients via the API...
	It implies --invisible and strictly ignores any GUI environment.
	
	--invisible
	Starts in invisible mode.
	Neither the start-up logo nor the initial program window will be visible. 	LO can be controlled and documents and dialogs can be opened via the API.
	When started with this parameter, it can only be quit using the taskmanager 		(Windows) or the kill command (UNIX based systems). 
	
2)To convert multiple pdf to single pdf
	$ sudo apt install poppler-utils
	$ pdfunite file1.pdf file2.pdf merged-output.pdf
	
	Note: Files to be merged need to be in the same directory where pdfunife is 	executed
	
3)To compress pdf
	$ sudo apt install ghostscript
	$ gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf
	
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/screen	Has a lower quality and smaller size. (72 dpi)
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook	Has a better quality, but has a slightly larger 		size (150 dpi)
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress	Output is of a higher size and quality (300 dpi)
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/printer	Output is of a printer type quality (300 dpi)
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/default	Selects the output which is useful for multiple 		purposes. Can cause large PDFS.
